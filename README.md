# Decision-tree

Decision trees are extensively used classifiers in data mining to predict the target variable for a given input variable.
Here the problem is to predict if a person will buy a computer or not based on certain attributes like age , income etc.
The model gives a decent accuracy of 67.0% which can be improved with addition of more data. 

This implementation was created for learning and academic purpose using a small dataset for training and testing.
